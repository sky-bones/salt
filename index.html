				You are trapped. They trapped you. You aren't sure who they are, but they have cold hands and left the scent of bitter coffee. It's dim. The light, however faint, comes from a far corner of this...cave. It's reflecting light in a peculiar way, faceted and sharp. You begin to come back to yourself, feeling around you. Your hand comes back wet and stinging, with the smell of copper and salt. Come to think of it, everything smells like salt. As your eyes adjust, you see the way the light reflects from the top of the cave, beams creating a soft, rosy glow. The area above your head is filled with rosy crystal.
			</p>

			<p class="kilo gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2">
				You hold your hand to your face, and notice the dark, seeping liquid. It's stopped stinging at least. Your eyes continue to adjust, and you see the flat area that you occupy. Your skin has taken on a blue tinge, you blood looking darker then it should. It's hard to look away from the sight. You become aware of a soft drip to your left, which echoes around and around you, and you notice what's below your ledge. A pool of liquid, disturbed by drops that fall from above. At the center of the pool, there lies a skull of some kind. It's not like what you've seen before, it's missing...missing most of its eye sockets. It only has two. The horns spiral out in a peculiar fashion.

				Something shifts in the darkness and begins to click. You stand, quietly. The clicks stop at the base of the pool and a spindly shape moves into it. All you can see is appendages. It's strange to look at. You touch the crystal beside you, and your hand clinks softly against it. There are dark, glassy tendrils surrounding your hand. Tapping them with your finger, the surface is hard and armor-like. And you can touch the crystals with it. You bite back fear and lay your other hand against a crystal. It stings and the smell of copper fills the air.
			</p>

			<p class="kilo gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2">
				Something below you tinkles, like glass shards falling. The appendages have moved, startled by the scent of coppery blood. It looks at you. You're not sure how you know, but it does. And it's starting to climb towards you. It's dark enough that the black shape becomes almost invisible as you panic, your dark glass hands and blue skin useless against this threat. So you run. You trip against sharp crystals and your left side aches and there's blood forming an area of glassy hardness, copper-smell fading. You rip yourself away from sight and start into the maze of razor-like rock. Towards the light. That's your goal.

				You run, and your skin is ripped by the crystals, black cold glass slowly forming armor in long tendrils, dripping off your arms and knees and leaving it shattered and splintered behind you. The sharp clicks behind you increase their tempo, and they sound so close to you and you can't seem to get away from the sounds of shattering glass. The pale light at the edge of the cave is the only thing that you can see at this point, it's all narrowed down to this gentle pink glow. You stumble over a crystal, and your hand catches a ledge. The armor encasing your limbs tinkles as you pull yourself upwards, closer and closer and then up again, more ledges, and the rustling and clicks are farther apart but still there and then the light is there to your left and you can taste the relief on your tongue.

				As you move towards the opening, you see how your skin looks, the more light that invades the space the darker your blood is and your skin... your skin is blue, not sickly but a bright, glowing blue, your hands only have five appendages how did you lose three digits, and you reach to your face...where are your eyes where are your eyeswhereareyoureyes all you can feel are the bones surrounding them and the thin delicate skin covering horrible horrible orbs and they somehow are letting you see and when you open your mouths to scream there is only one. The panic of your body overtakes the panic of the pursuing clicks. You try again, to open your mouths, that should have long teeth and have languages of their own but they are gone and you are alone with the clicks, no gentle languages murmuring, no eyes seeing the alternates, no.....the light. The light will have answers, you will create answers there.

				The clicks behind you stopped. There is a figure, tall and delicate looking, all limbs and emptiness and there is shadow wrapped around it like a cloak. The silence of it makes you feel more dread then the noise. The figure moves a spindly appendage into the light to reveal blackened bone-like arms that cast no shadow. Something in your hearts recoils from it. It begins to speak, speak in no language you know, but you can feel things clearing. Reasoning appears where there was panic, and you see the fear in it's trembling self, and you know that it risked something beyond damnation to tell you it's whispers.

				When the figure stopped its murmurs, it speaks in the common tongue. "fear the voice that claims answers where there is no truth." You blink the terrible orbs in your skull, and nod. The spindly figure quietly crumbles, the bone and shadow reduces to dust and the smell of heather. You take a breath with your single mouth, and then turn towards the light. Beyond it, there lies uncertainty. You grab the crystal that hangs just before the exit. The sharp pain and smell of copper fill your head, and you step into the light.

					When your eyes adjust to the brightness, everything you see seems to shiver. A voice, liquid and dark comes from just beyond the trembling plants and creatures. You move closer to the voice, seeing the sharp glass armor covering you, and the advice of the being ringing in your ears. "fear the voice that claims answers where there is no truth." This is the end, you think. The voice has become louder and clings to your jagged protection and you desperately wish for your missing eyes to see where this would lead.

				The voice speaks of salt, and how it changed the ways. It speaks of how it gave them sight, gave them courage. The voice pleads, pleads with you not to be angry. You are the first of the creations. It tells you of how it removed several of your hearts, used them to heal the others... how your eyes allow them to see, your mouths allow them to speak, and in return this body is your to live freely. You look around, with your weakened eyes, and see the creatures. They look to you in fear, cold and empty. The voice reminds you of your sacrifice, reminds you of how god-like you are. You created them! It cries, and you look to your strange hands, and how sharp and strong the glass is.

					You wonder how easy it would be to destroy life, to take away what you've been forced to give. What the voice has given them. Fear the voice that claims answers. Fear the reasons that it has give. It has created life which will never know the joy you did, it has created empty shells of creation, patched together with parts of your hearts and eyes and mouths. Fear the voice that claims answers where there is no truth. How can they these creatures know the truth, know what life is. How can the voice, is all its darkness know the pain in their eyes? It took your eyes and mouths and hearts, took your skin, and created life that wants nothing but to die.

			<p class="kilo gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2">
					So you walk to the voice, that rises in volume, colder and darker, speaking of reasons you are deaf to. There is no life to be created from these caves, no joy to be created. The creates behind you stir, and you hear them, the mouths, singing in gentle, strange languages. Urging you on. The voice is overwhelming, it has begun to drown out the songs. It begins to devour your sense of sight, and you are left in darkness with nothing but a dark liquid voice surrounding you. There are no answers for these creatures, no answers for you. You've been robbed of yourself, and they of a life.

					There is a calmness in your bones, and the glittering armor gives you hope. The voice has created nothing. It holds claim to an answer, one which you have no interest in. You've moved close enough to the voice that it has overpowered your ability to sense much of anything. The weakened eyes in your skull have adjusted enough allow light and shadow. The voice continues to plead with you, desperately whispering about salt, sobbing it's answers for why it has done this, and you feel nothing but disdain. Life wasn't meant to be made from the suffering of others, wasn't meant to be created to feel nothing but fear.

			<p class="kilo gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2">
				You stride to the source of the voice, the closer you move, the stronger it is, begging, pleading, wheedling, whispering its fear and anger. When you are close enough to look into the depths of the shadow that makes up the voice, it has fallen silent. There is no sound. You open out your hand, coated in glass, and notice the smell of bitter coffee. There are no answers here. You swipe your hand across the shadow, and are met with a soundless scream, one that echoes around your skull, and reverberates in your bones, and your hand comes back to you covered in sharp red liquid. The voice is gone. You can see, see the red and against the blue and black, and see the creatures, who have gathered together. You point to where you came from. There are no answers here.
